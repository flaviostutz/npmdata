# filedist

Publish folders as npm packages or git repositories and extract them in any workspace. Use it to distribute shared assets — ML datasets, documentation, ADRs, configuration files — across multiple projects through any npm-compatible registry or directly from git.

## How it works

- **Publisher**: a project that has folders to share. Running `init` prepares its `package.json` so those folders are included when the package is published.
- **Consumer**: any project that installs that package and runs `extract` to download the files locally. A `.filedist` marker file is written alongside the managed files to track ownership and enable safe updates.

## Extraction patterns

There are three ways to extract data with `filedist`. Choose the one that fits your situation:

### Pattern 1 — Ad-hoc CLI extraction

Use `npx filedist extract` directly from the command line whenever you need to pull files from a package without any prior setup.

```sh
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets@^2.0.0 --output ./data

# or use a git repository as the source
npx filedist extract --packages git:github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0 --output ./xdrs
```

Package specs support optional source prefixes. Use `git:` for git repositories and `npm:` when you want to make the npm source explicit. When no prefix is present, filedist treats the spec as npm. Git specs accept full repository URLs and host/path shorthands such as `git:github.com/org/repo.git@ref`.

#### Auto-save to `.filedistrc.yml`

Whenever `--packages` is used, filedist automatically creates or updates a `.filedistrc.yml` file in the current directory with the packages and selectors from that run. This means subsequent updates can be done with a single command — no flags needed:

```sh
# First run: extract and save to .filedistrc.yml automatically
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets@^2.0.0 --output ./data

# .filedistrc.yml is now created:
# sets:
#   - package: my-shared-assets@^2.0.0
#     output:
#       path: ./data

# Future bumps: just run extract (reads .filedistrc.yml)
npx filedist extract

# Or bump to a newer version
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets@^3.0.0 --output ./data
# .filedistrc.yml is updated in place (same entry, new version)
```

If the entry already exists in `.filedistrc.yml` with identical content, the file is left unchanged. Use `--no-save` to run a one-off extraction without reading or updating `.filedistrc.yml`:

```sh
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets@^2.0.0 --output ./tmp --no-save
```

### Pattern 2 — Data packages with embedded configuration

Create a dedicated npm package whose `package.json` declares an `filedist` config block. That config encodes the extraction sources, output directories, filtering rules, and any combination of upstream packages. Consumers install the data package and run its bundled script — they don't need to know the internals.

**Publisher** — add an `filedist` block to the data package's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-org-configs",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "filedist": {
    "sets": [
      {
        "package": "base-datasets@^3.0.0",
        "selector": { "files": ["datasets/**"] },
        "output": { "path": "./data/base" }
      },
      {
        "package": "org-configs@^1.2.0",
        "selector": { "contentRegexes": ["env: production"] },
        "output": { "path": "./configs" }
      },
      {
        "package": "git:github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0",
        "selector": { "files": ["docs/**"] },
        "output": { "path": "./xdrs" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Run `pnpm dlx filedist init` in that package and then `npm publish` to release it.

**Consumer** — just install and run:

```sh
npx my-org-configs extract --output ./local-data
```

No knowledge of the upstream packages or transformation rules is required.

**When to use:** When an intermediary team (a platform, infrastructure, or data team) wants to bundle, curate, and version a collection of data from multiple sources and hand it to consumers as a single, opinionated package. Consumers get a stable, self-describing interface; producers control all the complexity.

### Pattern 3 — Config file mode

Add an `filedist` configuration directly to a project's own `package.json` (or a `.filedistrc` file) and then run `filedist extract` without `--packages`. The CLI automatically loads the configuration and runs every entry, reusing the same runner logic as data packages.

**Consumer** — declare the config inline in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "filedist": {
    "defaultPresets": ["prod"],
    "sets": [
      {
        "package": "base-datasets@^3.0.0",
        "selector": { "files": ["datasets/**"] },
        "output": { "path": "./data" }
      },
      {
        "package": "git:github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0",
        "selector": { "files": ["docs/**"] },
        "output": { "path": "./xdrs" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Or write a standalone `.filedistrc` (JSON object at the top level):

```json
{
  "sets": [
    {
      "package": "base-datasets@^3.0.0",
      "selector": { "files": ["datasets/**"] },
      "output": { "path": "./data" }
    },
    {
      "package": "git:file:///absolute/path/to/local-repo@v2.0.0",
      "selector": { "files": ["conf/**"] },
      "output": { "path": "./local-conf" }
    }
  ]
}
```

For a local Windows path, use the same `file://` form with a drive letter, for example `git:file:///C:/work/local-repo@v2.0.0`.

Then run any command without `--packages`:

```sh
npx filedist           # same as 'npx filedist extract'
npx filedist extract   # reads config, extracts all entries or only defaultPresets when defined
npx filedist check     # checks the same effective set selection
npx filedist purge     # purges the same effective set selection
```

Config is resolved using [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig). Sources searched in order from the current directory:

| Source | Key / format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.filedistrc.local.yml` | YAML object with `"sets"` array | Local-only override; checked first; not searched in parent dirs |
| `package.json` | `"filedist"` key — object with `"sets"` array | |
| `.filedistrc` | JSON or YAML object with `"sets"` array | |
| `.filedistrc.json` | JSON object with `"sets"` array | |
| `.filedistrc.yaml` / `.filedistrc.yml` | YAML object with `"sets"` array | |
| `filedist.config.js` | CommonJS module exporting object with `sets` array | |

When `.filedistrc.local.yml` is present in the current directory it takes full priority over all other config sources. This is useful when you are developing a package that already ships its own filedist config (e.g. in `package.json`) but you need to run extra extractions locally — for example to pull other packages into your workspace — without those entries being part of the published package config.

All runner flags (`--dry-run`, `--silent`, `--verbose`, `--gitignore=false`, `--managed=false`, `--presets`, `--output`) work as usual.
When `filedist.defaultPresets` is defined, `extract`, `check`, and `purge` behave as if `--presets <tags>` had been passed automatically. Passing `--presets` explicitly overrides that configured default for the current invocation.
Use `--all` to ignore `defaultPresets` for one run and process every configured entry.

Config-file mode can mix npm packages and git repositories in the same `sets` array. Use the `git:` prefix for git entries.

**When to use:** When a consuming project wants to pin and automate a set of data extractions locally without publishing a separate data package. This is the lightest-weight approach — no extra package, no `init` step, just a config block and a single CLI call.

## Quick start

### 1. Prepare the publisher package

In the project whose folders you want to share:

```sh
# share specific folders by glob pattern (required)
pnpm dlx filedist init --files "docs/**,data/**,configs/**"

# also bundle an additional package so consumers get data from both sources
pnpm dlx filedist init --files "docs/**" --packages shared-configs@^1.0.0

# share multiple upstream sources, including git
pnpm dlx filedist init --files "docs/**" --packages "shared-configs@^1.0.0,git:github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0"

```

`init` updates `package.json` with the right `files`, `bin`, and `dependencies` fields so those folders are included when the package is published, and writes a thin `bin/filedist.js` entry point. Then publish normally:

```sh
npm publish
```

### 2. Extract files in a consumer project

```sh
# npm package examples
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets --output ./data
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets@^2.0.0 --output ./data
npx filedist extract --packages "my-shared-assets@^2.0.0,another-pkg@1.x" --output ./data
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets --files "**/*.md" --output ./docs
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets --content-regex "env: production" --output ./configs
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets --output ./data --force
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets --output ./data --gitignore=false
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets --output ./data --managed=false
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets --output ./data --dry-run
npx filedist extract --packages my-shared-assets@latest --output ./data --upgrade

# git source examples
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0 --output ./xdrs
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@main --output ./xdrs
npx filedist extract --packages "https://github.com/org/repo-a@v1.0.0,file:///tmp/repo-b@main" --output ./git-data
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0 --files "docs/**/*.md" --output ./docs
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0 --content-regex "Decision Outcome" --output ./filtered-docs
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0 --output ./xdrs --force
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0 --output ./xdrs --gitignore=false
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0 --output ./xdrs --managed=false
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0 --output ./xdrs --dry-run
npx filedist extract --packages https://github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@main --output ./xdrs --upgrade
```

`extract` logs every file change as it happens:

```
A	data/users-dataset/user1.json
M	data/configs/app.config.json
D	data/old-file.json
```

If the published package includes its own bin script (normally when it's prepared using "init") you can also call it directly so it extracts data that is inside the package itself:

```sh
npx my-shared-assets extract --output ./data
npx my-shared-assets check  --output ./data
```

When the data package defines multiple `filedist` entries in its `package.json`, you can limit which entries are processed using the `--presets` option. Only entries whose `presets` list includes at least one of the requested presets will be extracted; entries with no presets are skipped when a preset filter is active.

```sh
# run only entries tagged with "prod"
npx my-shared-assets --presets prod

# run entries tagged with either "prod" or "staging"
npx my-shared-assets --presets prod,staging
```

To use presets, add a `presets` array to each `filedist` entry in the data package's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "filedist": {
    "sets": [
      { "package": "my-shared-assets", "output": { "path": "./data" }, "presets": ["prod"] },
      { "package": "my-dev-assets",    "output": { "path": "./dev-data" }, "presets": ["dev", "staging"] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Check the /examples folder to see this in action

### Data package CLI options

When calling the bin script bundled in a data package, the following options are accepted. Options that overlap with per-entry settings override every entry globally, regardless of what is set in `package.json`.

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--output, -o <dir>` | Base directory for resolving all `output.path` values (default: cwd). |
| `--presets <preset1,preset2>` | Limit to entries whose `presets` overlap with the given list (comma-separated). |
| `--nosync [bool]` | Keep stale managed files on disk during extract instead of deleting them. `check` still reports them as extra drift. |
| `--gitignore [bool]` | Disable `.gitignore` management for every entry when set to `false`, overriding each entry's `gitignore` field. |
| `--managed [bool]` | Run every entry in unmanaged mode when set to `false`, overriding each entry's `managed` field. Files are written without a `.filedist` marker, without `.gitignore` updates, and without being made read-only. |
| `--dry-run` | Simulate changes without writing or deleting any files. |
| `--verbose, -v` | Print detailed progress information for each step. |

```sh
# disable gitignore management across all entries
npx my-shared-assets --gitignore=false

# keep stale managed files on disk during extract
npx my-shared-assets --nosync

# write all files as not-managed (editable, not tracked)
npx my-shared-assets --managed=false

# combine overrides
npx my-shared-assets --gitignore=false --managed=false --dry-run
```

### filedist entry options reference

Each entry in the `filedist.sets` array in `package.json` supports the following options:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `package` | `string` | required | Source spec to install and extract. Either npm (`my-pkg`, `npm:my-pkg@^1.2.3`) or git (`git:github.com/org/repo.git@ref`, `git:file:///tmp/repo@main`, `git:file:///C:/tmp/repo@main`). |
| `output.path` | `string` | `.` (cwd) | Directory where files will be extracted, relative to where the consumer runs the command. |
| `selector.files` | `string[]` | all files | Glob patterns to filter which files are extracted (e.g. `["data/**", "*.json"]`). |
| `selector.exclude` | `string[]` | `["package.json","bin/**","README.md","node_modules/**"]` (when `files` is unset), none otherwise | Glob patterns to exclude files even when they match `selector.files` (e.g. `["test/**", "**/*.test.*"]`). |
| `selector.contentRegexes` | `string[]` | none | Regex patterns (as strings) to filter files by content. Only files matching at least one pattern are extracted. |
| `output.force` | `boolean` | `false` | Allow overwriting existing files or files owned by a different package. |
| `output.mutable` | `boolean` | `false` | Skip files that already exist; mark extracted files as mutable (check ignores content changes). Cannot be combined with `force`. |
| `output.noSync` | `boolean` | `false` | Keep stale managed files on disk during extract instead of deleting them. `check` still reports them as extra drift until they are removed or synced. |
| `output.gitignore` | `boolean` | `true` | Create/update a `.gitignore` file alongside each `.filedist` marker file. Set to `false` to disable. |
| `output.managed` | `boolean` | `true` | Write files with a `.filedist` marker, `.gitignore` update, and read-only flag. Set to `false` to skip tracking. Existing files are skipped when set to `false`. |
| `output.dryRun` | `boolean` | `false` | Simulate extraction without writing anything to disk. |
| `selector.upgrade` | `boolean` | `false` | Force a fresh install of the package even when a satisfying version is already installed. |
| `silent` | `boolean` | `false` | Suppress per-file output, printing only the final result line. |
| `presets` | `string[]` | none | Presets used to group and selectively run entries with `--presets`. |
| `output.symlinks` | `SymlinkConfig[]` | none | Post-extract symlink operations (see below). |
| `output.contentReplacements` | `ContentReplacementConfig[]` | none | Post-extract content-replacement operations (see below). |

Top-level config fields:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `defaultPresets` | `string[]` | none | CLI-only fallback for config-file mode. `extract`, `check`, and `purge` behave as if `--presets <tags>` had been passed when the flag is omitted. |
| `postExtractCmd` | `string[]` | none | Command argv run after a successful non-dry-run `extract`. The first array item is the executable and the remaining items are its arguments. Full extract argv is appended. |

#### SymlinkConfig

After extraction, for each config the runner resolves all files/directories inside `output.path` that match `source` and creates a corresponding symlink inside `target`. Stale symlinks pointing into `output.path` but no longer matched are removed automatically.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `source` | `string` | Glob pattern relative to `output.path`. Every matching file or directory gets a symlink in `target`. Example: `"**\/skills\/**"` |
| `target` | `string` | Directory where symlinks are created, relative to the project root. Example: `".github/skills"` |

#### ContentReplacementConfig

After extraction, for each config the runner finds workspace files matching `files` and applies the regex replacement to their contents.

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `files` | `string` | Glob pattern (relative to the project root) selecting workspace files to modify. Example: `"docs/**\/*.md"` |
| `match` | `string` | Regex string locating the text to replace. Applied globally to all non-overlapping occurrences. Example: `"<!-- version: .* -->"` |
| `replace` | `string` | Replacement string. May contain regex back-references such as `$1`. Example: `"<!-- version: 1.2.3 -->"` |

Example with multiple options:

```json
{
  "filedist": {
    "sets": [
      {
        "package": "my-shared-assets@^2.0.0",
        "selector": {
          "files": ["docs/**", "configs/*.json"],
          "upgrade": true
        },
        "output": {
          "path": "./data",
          "gitignore": true,
          "symlinks": [
            { "source": "**\/skills\/**", "target": ".github/skills" }
          ],
          "contentReplacements": [
            { "files": "docs/**\/*.md", "match": "<!-- version: .* -->", "replace": "<!-- version: 2.0.0 -->" }
          ]
        },
        "presets": ["prod"]
      },
      {
        "package": "git:github.com/flaviostutz/xdrs-core@1.3.0",
        "selector": {
          "files": ["docs/**"],
          "upgrade": true
        },
        "output": {
          "path": "./xdrs",
          "gitignore": false
        },
        "presets": ["prod"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Check files are in sync

Verifies that every file in the output directory matches what is currently in the published package. When the target package itself declares `filedist.sets`, check recurses into those transitive dependencies — reporting drift at every level of the hierarchy without downloading anything new beyond what is already installed. Use `selector.presets` on an entry to restrict which of the target's sets are checked.

```sh
npx filedist check --packages my-shared-assets --output ./data
# exit 0 = in sync, exit 1 = drift or error

# check multiple packages
npx filedist check --packages "my-shared-assets,another-pkg" --output ./data
```

The check command reports differences per package:

```
  my-shared-assets@2.1.0: out of sync
    - missing:  data/new-file.json
    ~ modified: data/configs/app.config.json
    + extra:    data/old-file.json
```

#### Offline / local-only check

By default `check` installs packages (or uses an already-installed version) to detect *extra* files — files that exist in the package source but were never extracted. If you want a fast, fully offline check that skips all network and install steps, use `--local-only`:

```sh
npx filedist check --local-only
```

In this mode filedist reads the `.filedist` marker file for each output directory and verifies:

1. **File checksums** — every non-mutable file listed in the marker is hashed and compared against the checksum recorded at extraction time.

Extra-file detection (files in the source that were never extracted) is skipped because no package source is available. Use `--local-only` when:

- Running in a **CI environment** where the package registry is unavailable or you want to avoid install latency.
- Checking **air-gapped** or **offline** environments.
- You only care that previously extracted files have not been **locally tampered with**, and are not concerned about new files added to the upstream package since the last extract.

### 4. List managed files

```sh
# list all files managed by filedist in an output directory
npx filedist list --output ./data
```

Output is grouped by package:

```
my-shared-assets@2.1.0
  data/users-dataset/user1.json
  data/configs/app.config.json

another-pkg@1.0.0
  data/other-file.txt
```

### 5. Purge managed files

Remove all files previously extracted by one or more packages without touching any other files in the output directory. No network access or package installation is required — only the local `.filedist` marker state is used. When the target package itself declares `filedist.sets`, purge recurses into those transitive dependencies and removes their managed files too, mirroring what extract originally created.

```sh
# remove all files managed by a package
npx filedist purge --packages my-shared-assets --output ./data

# purge multiple packages at once
npx filedist purge --packages "my-shared-assets,another-pkg" --output ./data

# preview what would be deleted without removing anything
npx filedist purge --packages my-shared-assets --output ./data --dry-run
```

After a purge, the corresponding entries are removed from the `.filedist` marker file and any empty directories are cleaned up. `.gitignore` sections written by `extract` are also removed.

## Hierarchical package resolution

`extract`, `check`, and `purge` are all hierarchy-aware: when a target package or git repository carries its own `filedist.sets` block in its `package.json` or `.filedistrc*`, the command automatically recurses into those transitive dependencies.

This lets you build layered data package chains:

```
consumer project
  └─ my-org-configs          (npm package with filedist.sets)
       ├─ base-datasets       (another npm package with its own files)
       └─ org-templates       (another npm package with its own files)
            └─ raw-assets     (leaf package)
```

Running `npx filedist extract --packages my-org-configs --output ./data` will extract files from every package in the chain, not just `my-org-configs` itself.

When the source is git, filedist clones repositories into `.filedist-tmp` inside the working directory, adds that folder to `.gitignore` if needed, resolves nested config from the cloned repository, and removes `.filedist-tmp` when the command ends.

### Output path resolution

Each level's `output.path` is resolved relative to the caller's own `output.path`. A package at depth 1 with `output.path: "./configs"` and a transitive dependency with `output.path: "./shared"` will land at `./configs/shared`.

### Caller overrides (extract only)

When `extract` recurses, the caller's `output` flags are inherited by every transitive dependency, with caller-defined values always winning:

| Caller sets | Effect on transitive entries |
|---|---|
| `force: true` | Transitive entries also overwrite unmanaged / foreign files |
| `dryRun: true` | No files are written anywhere in the hierarchy |
| `mutable: true` | Existing files are skipped at every level; extracted files are marked as mutable |
| `gitignore: false` | No `.gitignore` entries are created anywhere |
| `managed: false` | All transitive files are written without a marker or read-only flag |
| `symlinks` / `contentReplacements` | Appended to each transitive entry's own lists |

Settings that are undefined on the caller are left as-is so the transitive package's own defaults apply.

### Filtering transitive sets with `selector.presets`

Set `selector.presets` on an entry to control which sets inside the target package are recursed into. Only sets whose `presets` tag overlaps with the filter are processed; sets with no `presets` are skipped when a filter is active.

```json
{
  "filedist": {
    "sets": [
      {
        "package": "my-org-configs@^2.0.0",
        "output": { "path": "./data" },
        "selector": { "presets": ["prod"] }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The same filtering is applied during `check` and `purge` so they stay in sync with what `extract` originally wrote.

### Circular dependency detection

If a package chain references itself (directly or transitively), the command stops immediately with an error rather than looping forever. Sibling packages — entries already being processed at the same level — are also skipped to prevent double-processing.

                           `git:github.com/org/repo.git@ref`, e.g.
                           "my-pkg@^1.0.0,git:github.com/org/repo.git@main"
  --output, -o <dir>       Output directory (default: current directory)
  --force                  Overwrite existing files or files owned by a different package
  --mutable                Skip files that already exist; mark extracted files as mutable (check ignores
                           content changes). Cannot be combined with --force
  --gitignore [bool]       Disable .gitignore management when set to false (enabled by default)
  --managed [bool]         Set to false to write files without a .filedist marker, .gitignore
                           update, or read-only flag. Existing files are skipped. Files can be
                           freely edited afterwards and are not tracked by filedist.
  --files <patterns>       Comma-separated glob patterns to filter files
  --content-regex <regex>  Regex to filter files by content
  --dry-run                Preview changes without writing any files
  --upgrade                Reinstall the package even if already present
  --silent                 Print only the final result line, suppressing per-file output
  --verbose, -v            Print detailed progress information for each step
  --no-save                Skip loading and updating the local .filedistrc.yml config file.
                           By default, when --packages is provided the run is saved to
                           .filedistrc.yml so future `filedist extract` calls (without
                           --packages) reuse the same config automatically.

Check options:
  --packages <specs>       Same format as extract.
                           When omitted, reads from a configuration file (see Pattern 3).
  --output, -o <dir>       Output directory to check (default: current directory)

Purge options:
  --packages <specs>       Comma-separated package names whose managed files should be removed.
                           When omitted, reads from a configuration file (see Pattern 3).
  --output, -o <dir>       Output directory to purge from (default: current directory)
  --dry-run                Simulate purge without removing any files
  --silent                 Suppress per-file output

List options:
  --output, -o <dir>       Output directory to inspect (default: current directory)
```

## Library usage

`filedist` also exports a programmatic API:

```typescript
import { actionExtract, actionCheck, actionList, actionPurge } from 'filedist';
import type { FiledistExtractEntry, ProgressEvent } from 'filedist';

const entries: FiledistExtractEntry[] = [
  { package: 'my-shared-assets@^2.0.0', output: { path: './data' } },
];
const cwd = process.cwd();

// extract files
const result = await actionExtract({ entries, cwd });
console.log(result.added, result.modified, result.deleted);

// dry-run: preview changes without writing files
const dryResult = await actionExtract({ entries: entries.map(e => ({ ...e, output: { ...e.output, dryRun: true } })), cwd });
console.log('Would add', dryResult.added, 'files');

// track progress file-by-file
await actionExtract({
  entries,
  cwd,
  onProgress: (event: ProgressEvent) => {
    if (event.type === 'file-added')    console.log('A', event.file);
    if (event.type === 'file-modified') console.log('M', event.file);
    if (event.type === 'file-deleted')  console.log('D', event.file);
  },
});

// check sync status
const summary = await actionCheck({ entries, cwd });
const hasDrift = summary.missing.length > 0 || summary.modified.length > 0 || summary.extra.length > 0;
if (hasDrift) {
  console.log('Missing:', summary.missing);
  console.log('Modified:', summary.modified);
  console.log('Extra:', summary.extra);
}

// remove all managed files (no network required)
await actionPurge({ entries, config: null, cwd });

// list all files managed by filedist in an output directory
const managed = await actionList({ entries, config: null, cwd });
// ManagedFileMetadata[]: Array<{ path: string; packageName: string; packageVersion: string }>
```

### `ProgressEvent` type

```typescript
type ProgressEvent =
  | { type: 'package-start'; packageName: string; packageVersion: string }
  | { type: 'package-end';   packageName: string; packageVersion: string }
  | { type: 'file-added';    packageName: string; file: string }
  | { type: 'file-modified'; packageName: string; file: string }
  | { type: 'file-deleted';  packageName: string; file: string }
  | { type: 'file-skipped';  packageName: string; file: string };
```

### `postExtractCmd`

Set `postExtractCmd` at the top level of your config to run a command after a successful non-dry-run `extract`.
Use an argv array such as `["node", "scripts/post-extract.js"]`; shell strings are rejected so common quoting mistakes fail clearly.

See the root [README.md](../README.md) for the full documentation.

## Managed file tracking

Extracted files are set read-only (`444`) and tracked in a `.filedist` marker file in each output directory. On subsequent extractions:

- Unchanged files are skipped.
- Updated files are overwritten.
- Files removed from the package are deleted locally.

The marker file uses a `|`-delimited format; files written by older versions of `filedist` using the comma-delimited format are read correctly for backward compatibility.

Multiple packages can coexist in the same output directory; each owns its own files.

## Developer Notes

### Module overview

| Folder / file | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/cli/` | CLI entry-points: argument parsing, help text, config loading, per-command handlers |
| `src/package/` | Package-level orchestration: config resolution, fileset iteration, purge and init coordination |
| `src/fileset/` | File-level extraction, diff, check, and sync logic |
| `src/types.ts` | Shared TypeScript types |
| `src/utils.ts` | Low-level utilities: package install, glob/hash helpers, package manager detection |
| `src/index.ts` | Public API surface |

### Marker file (`.filedist`)

Each output directory that contains managed files gets a `.filedist` CSV file. Columns: `path`, `packageName`, `packageVersion` — one row per file, no header. This is the source of truth for ownership tracking and clean removal.

### Key design decisions

- File identity is tracked by path + hash, not by timestamp, to be deterministic across machines.
- Extract uses a two-phase diff + execute model: compute all changes first, then apply them, enabling conflict detection and rollback before any file is written.
- The bin shim generated by `filedist init` contains no logic; all behaviour is versioned inside this library.

### Dev workflow

```
make build lint-fix test
```

This maintainer workflow uses `make` and a bash-compatible shell. On Windows, use WSL or run the equivalent `pnpm` commands inside `lib/` directly.
